Hi I'm Leo Valmont and I am interesting in learning about Cripto actives regulation, web 3 and blockchain.
I am a lawyer master in European Union Law, I live in Portugal and I would like to work remotly in this web 3 legal field.
I’m currently learning all I can by myself but I don't have pratical experience,
I exchage crypto on the plataforms since the year 2018.
I’m looking to collaborate on the purpose of allowing everyone to have access to cryptocurrency...
